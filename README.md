# Pixel_based_MPS
This repository contains the codes and data for a pixel_based multiple-point geostatistical simulation method.
The related reference manuscript for this repository is submitted to the Mathematical Geosciences Journal.
The paper title is "Stochastic Embedding and Density-based Clustering of Image Patterns for Pixel-based Multiple-Point Geostatistical Simulation".
The manuscript is currrently under reveiw, and we are finalizing our codes for uploading in this repository as soon as possible.
